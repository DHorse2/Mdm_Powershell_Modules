Yes, PowerShell can exhibit odd behavior if it is running old code that is retained in memory. This can happen for several reasons:

    1. Session State: PowerShell maintains a session state, which means that variables, functions, and modules loaded in the current session remain in memory until the session is closed or the variables/functions are explicitly removed. If you redefine a function or variable without restarting the session, the old version may still be in memory.

    2. Module Caching: If you are using modules, PowerShell caches them. If you make changes to a module and do not reload it, PowerShell may still be using the old version. You can use Import-Module -Force to reload a module.

    3. Function Definitions: If you define a function and then redefine it in the same session, the old definition will be replaced, but if there are any references to the old function (like event handlers or callbacks), they may still point to the old code.

    4.Script Block Caching: PowerShell caches script blocks, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the script block is modified after it has been executed.

    5. Background Jobs: If you are running background jobs, they may be using an older version of the code or variables that were defined before the job started.

To troubleshoot odd behavior, you can try the following:

    1. Good. Restart the PowerShell session to clear all cached variables and functions.
    2. Not deterministic. Use Get-Command to check if a function or command is defined and what version is currently in use.
    3. Poor. Use Remove-Variable or Remove-Item to clear specific variables or functions that may be causing issues.
    4. Poor. Use Get-Module to check which modules are loaded and their versions.

If you continue to experience issues, consider providing more details about the specific behavior you're observing for more targeted assistance.
