NAME
Mdm Bootstrap

SYNOPSIS
    Bootstrap the (MDM) Development Environment on a Windows 10/11 platform.

DESCRIPTION
    Set registry, Path and load PowerShell modules
    This is the first step of setting up the Development Environment.
    The Initialize-Dev_Env_Win function is the main function.
    This updates the Windows Environment variables.
    It installs these powershell modules to the system's directories.
    It sets registry, Path and load PowerShell modules.
    It can elevate its own permissions if needed.

OUTPUTS
    The Mdm Bootstrap Module functions.

EXAMPLE
    Import-module Mdm_Bootstrap

NOTES
    I originally had each function a .ps1 file:
    I had issues. It is the "dot sourcing" issue found online.
    The solution needs Full Language Mode to run.
    ```powershell
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Assert-SecElevated.ps1"
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Export-ModuleMemberScan.ps1"
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Get-DirectoryNameFromSaved.ps1"
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Get-FilesNamesFromSaved.ps1"
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Set-SavedToDirectoryName.ps1"
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Set-LocationToPath"
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Wait-AnyKey.ps1"
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Wait-CheckDoPause.ps1"
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Wait-YorNorQ.ps1"
    ```
    I now have a module .psm1 file but the .ps1 file are components or classes:
    ```powershell
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Mdm_Std_Library.psm1"
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Mdm_Std_Help.ps1"
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Mdm_Std_Etl.ps1"
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Mdm_Std_Script.ps1"
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Mdm_Std_Error.ps1"
        . "$PSScriptRoot\Mdm_Std_Module.ps1"
    ```

    You have to dot source ". xxx" these in your .PSM1 file.
    Also: See function Export-ModuleMember. 
    This also failed for the same reasons.
    
    Regardless: This is powershell best practices,
    and similar to modules in the wild.
    Additionally, the PSM1 file get unwieldly large
    while using the above technique isolates the functions
    making them easier to find.

    (It seems) the main difference is they typically use .net (C#).
    That isn't a barrier beyond wanting to master (THIS) powershell syntax.

    SOLUTION: This was caused by the registry's environment setting:
        __PSLockDownPolicy
    This is 4 (Constrained) and needs to be (8) Full Language Mode
    Note: This reduces the security of the system. todo
    The bootstrap modules contains solution to alter this setting.
