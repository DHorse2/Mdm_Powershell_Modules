NAME
Mdm Standard Library

SYNOPSIS
    Mdm Standard Functions Library addresses cross-cutting functionality.

DESCRIPTION
    The Mdm (dba MacroDM) Standard Library is used by the other modules.
    It addresses cross-cutting functionality.
    This includes managing state, permissions, exceptions, path and files.
    Also other functions like pausing, prompting, displaying and searching.
    Also, help functions to auto-generate help more concisely & verbose.
    The universally available switches appear here.

    Global Setting
    These are initialized on the first import. 
    1. You can set them permanently. They are found at the top of the psm1 file.
    2. You can also set them after the std include for script specific requirements.
    For example, altering the logFileName as needed. 

PARAMETER DoPause
    Switch: Pause between steps.

PARAMETER DoVerbose
    Switch: Verbose output and prompts.

PARAMETER DoDebug
    Switch: Debug this script.
